# ðŸŽµ PB-SubSounds ðŸŽµ  
  
This is a simple extension for Phantombot, allowing you to easily create user-specific sound alerts for Twitch subscribers or optionally for every user.  
  
**Why is this better than just using PBs built-in commands to trigger sounds?**  

âœ… No need to create individual commands for every user. Keeps your command list clean.  
âœ… One single command for everyone to use.  
âœ… Multiple sounds per user are possible.  
âœ… No additional setup. Just feed the bot with your sounds and it will handle the rest for you.  
  
  
## Get started  
  
1. Download from releases tab and drag the content of the zip file inside your phantombot directory. (includes english language file only)  
2. (Re)Start your bot.  
  
(3. Sub-Mode is enabled out of the box. To allow everyone, including non-subs, to use sounds, use the `**!togglesubsounds**` command.)  
  
The standard command to trigger SubSounds is `**!subsound**`. The command can be customized to your liking simply by creating an alias (like !hi).  
  
>âš  I recommend to set a user-specific cooldown, so no one can spam their sound. (On the web panel go to `Commands -> Default -> !subsound -> >Edit`, change the cooldown value and untick the "Global" checkbox to apply the cooldown per-user)
  
### Get your sounds ready:  
This extension uses Phantombot's built-in audio hooks system, so you can drop the soundfiles where you normally would. Just make sure, that the filename of your soundfiles corresponds with the username they belong to.  
*Example:* Soundfile for user "MrKappa123" should be named `MrKappa123.mp3` or `mrkappa123.mp3` (Upper/Lowercase does not matter)  
  
### Assigning multiple sounds to a user:  
This can be easily done by adding a suffix to the soundfile's name. This suffix is also the command argument that's used to play that sound.  
*Example:* An additional soundfile for user "MrKappa123" can be named `MrKappa123_[YourSuffix].mp3` and the command would be `!subsound [YourSuffix]` or for the filename `MrKappa123_Scream.mp3` the command would be `!subsound scream`.
